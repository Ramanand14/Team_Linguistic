We have created a web application which can convert the Hinglish text to English text. Our application can also convert the short notations to its respective long notations. We have also taken input from the user in 4 different methods:
1. Keyboard
2. Virtual Keyboard
3. Voice
4. File

We have used Flask as web framework which is written in python. We have used to sqlite database to store all the short notations - long notations.
